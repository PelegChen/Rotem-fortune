## What is a PWA?

A PWA (Progressive Web App) is a web application that uses modern web capabilities to provide a user experience similar to that of mobile applications. PWAs are installable and live on the user's home screen, without the need for an app store. They offer an immersive full-screen experience with help from a web app manifest file and can even re-engage users with web push notifications.
